Knowing your cars’ average fuel consumption per mile (or kilometre) can not
only help you make significant savings on fuel costs.It can also serve as a
reasonably accurate indicator of your car’s overall state of health or repair.
If your driving style/pattern has not changed, any sudden changes in your
average fuel consumption (both up and down), can alert you to incipient problems
that may develop into serious issues and hefty repair bills if the cause of the
change is not investigated and corrected.It is important not to change your
driving style during the initial calculation period. The object of calculating
your average fuel consumption is to obtain a baseline value that can be used
as a guide to making adaptations or changes to your driving style or pattern.
If you obtain a false value as a baseline, you won’t necessarily be able to
spot the areas in which you need to make corrections to reduce your overall
fuel consumption, which defeats the purpose of the exercise.
